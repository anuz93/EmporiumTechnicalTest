1. What is wrong with the component you chose?

The component I chose is the burger menu and navigation bar on mobile view:

- When toggling the navigation bar with the burger icon, it takes over the whole page and blurs out everything outside the navigation menu
- Navigation bar can only be closed when clicking on close button
- User isn't able to see which list item expands into more sub options and which ones take them to a new page
- The alignment of the burger icon to the navigation bar looks somewhat unusual to the eye, the icon itself is below the logo, but navigation menu appears right at the very top

2. How would you improve it?

- Toggling the burger icon will bring up the navigation bar from the left side of the screen and "push" the main body content of the website to the right of the navigation bar

3. Given more time what what you further improve?

- Add a click event listener outside of the navigation bar to close it, rather than just being able to close it with the close option
- Add some kind of symbol or arrow to make it evident that clicking on a certain list item will further expand into more options
- Give the navigation bar a generally more modern/aesthetically pleasing look. Although current one looks good enough
